# 🏆 Rare Jersey Marketplace — Survey Analytics Dashboard

A Streamlit-based analytics dashboard that validates demand for a digital marketplace app where collectors and fans can buy and sell rare, game-worn, and collectible sports jerseys.

Built as part of the **DAIDM (Data Analytics for Informed Decision Making)** course at **SP Jain School of Global Management, GMBA Programme**.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project uses survey data (2,500 responses) to validate whether a dedicated marketplace for rare sports jerseys has viable demand. The analysis covers:

- **Demographics** — Who are the potential users?
- **Fan Profiling** — What type of collectors exist and what do they want?
- **Purchase Behavior** — How much will they spend? How often?
- **Platform Validation** — Would they actually use this app?
- **Correlation Analysis** — What drives purchase decisions?

## 🔧 Data Pipeline

### Raw Data (data_raw.csv)
- 2,515 rows (2,500 base responses + 15 simulated duplicate submissions)
- 26 columns mapping to 25 survey questions
- Includes injected noise: missing values (~2–3%), typos, inconsistent casing, outliers

### Cleaning Steps (data_cleaning.py)
1. **Duplicate removal** — Identifies and removes 15 duplicate rows
2. **Text standardization** — Fixes gender typos (M, male, MALE → Male), nationality inconsistencies
3. **Missing value imputation** — Mode-based, context-aware (income imputed within nationality cluster)
4. **Numeric encoding** — Converts ordinal categories to midpoint values
5. **Derived features** — Collector_Score, Value_Sensitivity, Auth_Rarity_Index
6. **Binary target** — Platform_Adoption (Definitely/Probably yes = 1)
7. **Outlier flagging** — Identifies inconsistent responses without removing them
8. **Multi-select parsing** — Splits Q22 trust factors into 5 binary columns
9. **Ranking extraction** — Extracts top-ranked feature from Q25
